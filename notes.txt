Check gcc version with gcc --version
After compiling, you can run with ./main or whatever it is called. This will run in terminal

Just so i can remember, forward slash has slope = 1 (or even 2 or 3), while
backslash is a negative sloping line.

Learned how to use the debugger for the first time.

when using cpp, i need to use g++ to compile. I didn't know that I could use the binary output of my cpp file here and run it via:
./test

Cool stuff. I want to dive deeper into this and lower level programming.

Back to work tomorrow and probably won't touch this for a little bit, but I'm going to get through OSTEP and learn a lot of C in the process. I'm assuming that C and C++ are going to be similar, as I'm able to compile them both with the same extension/libraries.

C:
- does not support objects, classes, inheritence
- known for speed, the "god of programming languages"
- procedural language

C++:
- offers more abstraction and functionality that python is known for
- OOP
